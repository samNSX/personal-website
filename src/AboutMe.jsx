        <p className="my-5 leading-[37px]">
          I am a Business Administration and Marketing major currently at
          California State University Fullerton. I am expected to graduate
          Spring 2023 with my Bachelorâ€™s. While I have not held any jobs that
          pertained to marketing, I have had to privilege to help the marketing
          team at my workplace, Gigabyte Technology; where I have been working
          since 2017. At first I started off as a warehouse employee but then I
          transferred in early 2019 as a technical support representative.
          Because I have been in the tech industry since I was 17, I mainly want
          to stay in the realm of PC hardware, however; I am interested in the
          motorsport industry as well. But for now, my forte lies in PC
          hardware. I hope you find things here on the site, informative and
          interesting.
